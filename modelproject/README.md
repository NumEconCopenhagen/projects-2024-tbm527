# Model Project

## Overview
This project uses a Python-based economic model to analyze the impact of various parameters on key economic indicators like GDP per capita, real wages, real interest rates, and the percentage deviation in GDP per capita. 

The model equations and functions are defined in `modelproject.py`, while `modelproject.ipynb` is used for executing the model and visualizing the results.

## Files
- `modelproject.py`: Contains the definitions of the economic model, utilizing Python classes and functions to simulate different economic scenarios.
- `modelproject.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook imports the definitions from `modelproject.py`, and provides visualizations, descriptions, and explanations to demonstrate the model and also the impact of parameter changes on the economy.

## Model Description
This project particularly explores two scenarios involving changes in the employment rate (\(\lambda\)) and also incorporates changes in several key parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\phi\)) that influence various economic outcomes:

## Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are needed:
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `types.SimpleNamespace`: For organizing model parameters easily.
