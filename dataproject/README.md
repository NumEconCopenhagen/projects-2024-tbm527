# Data Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to apply data cleaning, data structuring methods, data analysis methods, and visualize the data.

The data used in this project is downloaded as an Excel file from statistikbanken.dk. The data concerns condominiums (ejerlejligheder) in Denmark that have been available for free trading from 1992-2023. The data is divided into two data sets. The first data set concerns average prices per condominium (in 1000 DKK). The second data set concerns the number of condominium sales.

## Files
- `data.xlsx`: Contains the raw data on condominiums in Denmark, with average prices and the number of sales.
- `dataproject.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that imports the data from `data.xlsx`, performs data cleaning and analysis, and provides visualizations to demonstrate the trends and insights derived from the data.

## Data Description
This project particularly focuses on the analysis of two key data sets:
- Average prices per condominium (in 1000 DKK)
- Number of condominium sales

The analysis covers the period from 1992 to 2023, highlighting trends and significant changes over time.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are needed:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `plotly`: For interactive graphing and plotting.
