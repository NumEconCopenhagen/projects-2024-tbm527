The title for this project is **DATA PROJECT**. The purpose of this project is to apply data cleaning, data structuring methods, data analysis methods and visualize the data.

The data used in this project is downloaded as an Excel-file from statistikbanken.dk. The data concerns condominiums (ejerlejligheder) in Denmark that have been available for free trading from 1992-2023. The data is devided into two data sets. The first data set concerns average prices per condominium (in 1000 DKK). The second data set concerns the number of condominium sales. The data sets are in the Excel-file:
    data.xlsx

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    pip install plotly 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running dataproject.ipynb. Press 'Run All'.
