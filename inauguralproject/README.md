# Inaugural Project

## Overview
The inaugural project aims to teach you to solve a simple economic model and present the results.

## Files
- `inauguralproject.py`: Contains the definitions of the economic model, utilizing Python classes and functions to simulate different economic scenarios.
- `InauguralProject.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that imports the definitions from `inauguralproject.py`, executes the model, and provides visualizations to demonstrate the impact of parameter changes on the economy.

## Model Description
This project explores an exchange economy with two consumers (A and B) and two goods (x1 and x2). The initial endowments and utility functions for consumers are given, and the project involves solving for market equilibrium and visualizing the results.

## Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are needed:
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting graphs.
- `scipy`: For optimization routines.
