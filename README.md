## Overview
This repository contains the following projects:

### Inaugural Project
The inaugural project aims to teach you to solve a simple economic model and present the results. This project demonstrates your ability to apply numerical solution and simulation methods, structure a code project, document code, and present results in both text and figures.

### Data Project
The purpose of this project is to apply data cleaning, data structuring methods, data analysis methods, and visualize the data. The data used in this project is downloaded as an Excel file from statistikbanken.dk and concerns condominiums (ejerlejligheder) in Denmark available for free trading from 1992-2023.

### Model Project
This project uses a Python-based economic model to analyze the impact of various parameters on key economic indicators like GDP per capita, real wages, real interest rates, and the percentage deviation in GDP per capita.

### Exam Project
The exam project includes solving complex economic models, data analysis, and presenting the findings. The exam focuses on three main problems:
1. **Production economy and CO2 taxation**
2. **Career choice model**
3. **Barycentric interpolation**

## Repository Structure
- `inauguralproject/`: Contains the Inaugural Project files.
- `dataproject/`: Contains the Data Project files.
- `modelproject/`: Contains the Model Project files.
- `examproject/`: Contains the Exam Project files.

Each project folder includes:
- Python scripts (`.py` files) for model definitions and functions.
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for executing the models and visualizations.
- Data files as needed for the specific project.
